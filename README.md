## How We Met the Assignment Requirements

1. Be responsive on both tablet and cell-phone sized screens.
    - We added media queries to the end of the CSS file to ensure all content would be responsive on desktops, tablets, landscape phone orientations, and portait phone orientations.
    
2.	Use CSS flexbox at least once.
    - We used flexbox in numerous places including the title, navbar, and footer. 
3.	Use semantic HTML tags where appropriate.
    - Semantic HTML tags were used at every appropriate instance.
4.	Utilize BEM naming conventions for its CSS rules.
    - All CSS rules were named using the BEM conventions.
5.	Include at least one usage of CSS transitions.
    - The navbar links include a hover transition.
6.	Include at least one usage of CSS animations.
    - The footer includes a continuous animation that mimics an explosion to reflect the content of the movie.
7.	Include a README in the GitHub repository for the project that details any challenges encountered during development as well as a link to the deployed website.
    - We have included this README file.
